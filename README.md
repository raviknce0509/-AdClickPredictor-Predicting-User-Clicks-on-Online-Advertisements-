# AdClickPredictor
"AdClickPredictor" is a repository exploring online ad engagement prediction using machine learning. It provides a dataset with user attributes and interaction outcomes, guiding users through preprocessing, modeling, and performance assessment via a comprehensive Deepnote notebook. 

Here is a step-by-step guide to follow for the project:

**Step 1: Project Setup and Dataset Understanding**

. **Dataset Exploration:** Load the dataset into a Jupyter notebook and explore it. Understand the structure of the data, the features available, and the target variable ('Clicked on Ad').

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

**Handling Missing Data:** Check for missing values in the dataset and decide how to handle them (imputation or removal).

**Feature Selection and Engineering:** Analyze the features and decide which ones are relevant for predicting ad clicks. Create new features if necessary.

**Data Transformation:** Encode categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding and scale numerical features if needed.

**Step 3: Model Development**

**Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

**Choose Algorithm:** Select a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting) based on your dataset's characteristics.

**Model Training:** Train the selected model on the training dataset.

**Step 4: Model Evaluation and Tuning**

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve performance.

**Step 5: Insights Extraction**

**Generate Insights:** Utilize your trained model to predict ad clicks on new data points. Use the model to predict whether users will click on ads based on their features.

**Interact with Model:** Create a user interface or script that allows you to input user data and get predictions from the model.

**Step 6: Further Analysis and Refinement**

**Analysis of Results:** Interpret the model's predictions to gain insights into user behavior and ad performance.

**Refinement:** Based on the analysis, refine your marketing strategies and ad targeting approaches.
